summary: "A fishing simulator game for ICS 211"
---

This game simulates fishing for Hawaiʻi-based fish over the course of 12 months. It is a two-player game with alternating turns. On each turn, a player chooses a pond to fish from and selects a method of fishing: net, pole, or spear.

If a fish is caught, the player is informed of the fish’s size, weight, diet, and whether it is legal to keep during that month—since certain fish are protected during specific times of the year. After learning this information, the player decides whether to keep the fish and place it in their bag.

If the fish is illegal and the player chooses to keep it, they risk being fined by the police department. Alternatively, they may attempt to bribe the police to avoid the penalty. If their bribe fails the player gets a larger fine.

Each player gets two turns per month. After 12 months, the player with the most fish, the largest fish, and the heaviest total catch wins the game.
