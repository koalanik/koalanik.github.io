## Coding Standards in General
Coding standards are a mixed bag for me. Some people swear by them to improve code quality, but I find them valuable and frustrating, depending on the situation. Take learning a new programming language, for example. Some coding standards can actually help you learn faster. They encourage good habits, like keeping your code clean and avoiding common mistakes. But most of the time, they feel like an extra hassle. They add a layer of rules when you’re already struggling to figure out the basics, which can make the whole process tedious and annoying.

## VS Code & ESLint
My experience with ESLint has been a prime example of this. I haven’t even gotten it to work correctly yet, and I’m already stuck dealing with errors that pop up before I’ve done much of anything. It’s frustrating and makes me question if it’s worth the effort. On the other hand, I do find VSCode interesting, and I want to keep exploring what it can do. I can see the potential for tools like ESLint to be helpful down the road, but not right now (it will probably be helpful in about a month).

## A Rant on Coding Standards
The value of coding standards really depends on where you are in your learning journey. Some rules, like avoiding global variables or writing meaningful names, are genuinely helpful and teach you things that matter. But other rules, like debating single versus double quotes, feel more like nitpicking. For a beginner, it’s better to start small and focus on the essentials before worrying about every little detail.
